## English

Bruce Lee was an actor, philosopher, film director, producer, screenwriter and martial artist. He was born in November 1940 and died July 1973 from a mysterious brain hemorrhage.

Many consider Bruce Lee to be one of the most influential martial artists of the 20th century. His films took martial arts to a whole new level.

He was a pioneer when it came to making Chinese martial arts more popular in the west.

He still to this day is considered a legend, and his philosophy lives on through his martial art Jeet Kune Do and through his writing.

When I grew up, I always looked up to Bruce Lee. He was this short guy, who weighed very little, yet seemed to have the power of a lion. He inspired, motivated and showed me that I don’t have to listen to the boundaries people impose on me. I make my own life, and I decide my faith.

Here are 11 powerful life lessons I learned from Bruce Lee:

## Goals

“A GOAL IS NOT ALWAYS MEANT TO BE REACHED, IT OFTEN SERVES SIMPLY AS SOMETHING TO AIM AT.”

Goals serve as something to aim for, so don’t get too hung up on reaching them. Focus on enjoying the journey and the process.

If you’re hiking on a beautiful trail, your goal is to get to your end destination, but that doesn’t mean you can’t enjoy the walk, or even change direction. Be open, be flexible.

## Flexibility

“NOTICE THAT THE STIFFEST TREE IS MOST EASILY CRACKED, WHILE THE BAMBOO OR WILLOW SURVIVES BY BENDING WITH THE WIND.”

The happiest people in the world are flexible. They do not have rigid beliefs or try to control and manipulate their surroundings to make them happy.

They are okay with how things are. They accept, they live in the now and they breathe. If you want to have a fulfilling and happy life, be flexible and accept things as they are.

## Time

“IF YOU LOVE LIFE, DON’T WASTE TIME, FOR TIME IS WHAT LIFE IS MADE UP OF.”

There’s no time for procrastinating, making excuses and succumbing to your fears. I know it can be hard, but you will ultimately die, so why not make the best of your life?

Don’t waste time, instead start boldly moving towards your dreams. You will fail and make mistakes along the way, so stay humble and stay in the now.

## Service

“REAL LIVING IS LIVING FOR OTHERS.”

The most satisfying way to live is to help and enrich the life of others. It wasn’t until I started my blog that I realized how satisfying it is to assist others.

If you can find a way to solve other people’s problems while following your passion, you will have found the ideal way to live.

## Acceptance

“TAKE NO THOUGHT OF WHO IS RIGHT OR WRONG OR WHO IS BETTER THAN. BE NOT FOR OR AGAINST.”

If we want the earth to become better, we have to let go of judgment, prejudice and rigid beliefs. There is no need to be right or wrong, or say that you are better than someone else.

Everything is as it is. If you do not like it, you can do something else, but do not inject negative energy, because it never does any good.

## Single-Mindedness

“I FEAR NOT THE MAN WHO HAS PRACTICED 10,000 KICKS ONCE, BUT I FEAR THE MAN WHO HAS PRACTICED ONE KICK 10,000 TIMES.”

If you want to get results and master something, you have to stop dabbling and jumping around from thing to thing. Commit to something and follow through.

Most people quit before any results can appear. They give up too soon. Don’t be one of those people!

## Creativity

“USING NO WAY AS WAY, USING NO LIMITATION AS LIMITATION.”

You impose your own limitations. Even if a guru tells you that something is impossible doesn’t mean it is. He or she is human just like you.

Remember, most great people were told they could never accomplish something, but they went ahead and did it anyway. Listen to yourself and do what excites you.

## Simplicity

“SIMPLICITY IS THE KEY TO BRILLIANCE.”

Simplify your life and eliminate the unnecessary. We as a society have been taught to consume and amass material possessions.

Luckily, we are starting to realize that this doesn’t work. Happiness comes from the inside, not from the outside. Simplicity gives you clarity and peace of mind.

## Find Your Path

“ABSORB WHAT IS USEFUL, DISCARD WHAT IS NOT, ADD WHAT IS UNIQUELY YOUR OWN.”

In the beginning, learn from someone you look up to, but as you get better and more successful, take what works and discard what doesn’t.

We are all unique, so we have to find our own groove and start listening to ourselves. Listen to your heart for guidance. Where is it trying to pull you?

## Take Action

“KNOWING IS NOT ENOUGH, YOU MUST APPLY; WILLING IS NOT ENOUGH, YOU MUST DO.”

You can read all the information you want, but if you never take action, nothing will happen. You will almost never have crystal clear clarity, so you will have to work through confusion and uncertainty.

I know you want a rock-solid guarantee that will tell you that you will be successful, but in reality, no such thing exists. You have to start moving in order to get to where you want to be.

## Ego

“THE MARTIAL ARTS ARE ULTIMATELY SELF-KNOWLEDGE. A PUNCH OR A KICK IS NOT TO KNOCK THE HELL OUT OF THE GUY IN FRONT, BUT TO KNOCK THE HELL OUT OF YOUR EGO, YOUR FEAR, OR YOUR HANG-UPS.”

Everything you do involves your ego. It’s the one that is afraid. It wants you to stay where things are comfortable, convenient and safe.

If you listen to your heart, you know that this isn’t the path for you. Go after your dreams and do so boldly. Accept the fear inside you and keep moving.

Life is meant to be lived, so start living and following your passion.

## 中文

之前打開Chrome瀏覽器時，Momentum顯示了「Absorb what is useful, Discard what is not, Add what is uniquely your own.」—Bruce Lee就讓我好奇去Google一下李小龍曾經還有講過那些話，除了這句話之外，最讓我動容的是「我不害怕曾經練過一萬種踢法的人，但我害怕一種踢法練過一萬次的人。」一個功夫這麼厲害的人，提醒我自己不忘的那句話「成功沒有奇蹟，只有累積。」

## 目標

「目標並不是一定要達到的，它通常只是努力的方向。」

目標是努力的方向，不要為達成目標而停滯不前。把注意力放在享受這個旅程和過程上。如果你在一處風景勝地徒步旅行，你的目標是到達最後的目的地，但那並不意味著你不能沿途欣賞，甚至是改變目的地。豁達一點，靈活一點。

## 變通

「要知道，筆直的樹是最易崩裂的，而竹子或柳樹卻能經得起風的肆虐。」

世界上最幸福的人是懂得變通的人。他們沒有一成不變的信仰，也不會試圖通過控制和利用周圍的人來取悅自己。他們認可所有事物。他們接受現實，活在當下。如果你想擁有知足幸福的人生，靈活一點並接受事物原來的樣子。

## 時間

「如果你熱愛生活，不要浪費時間，因為生活是由時間組成的。」

沒有時間可以用來拖遝、尋找藉口或者屈服於自己的恐懼。我知道這或許很難，但你最後依然會走向死亡，所以為什麼我盡力地好好生活？不要浪費時間，要勇於向夢想出發。途中可能會失敗、會犯錯，所以謙和一點，實際一點。

## 付出

「真正的生活是為他人而活。」

最令人滿足的生活就是幫助別人，並使他們的生活豐富起來。直到我開通博客才意識到幫助別人是多麼令人滿足。如果你通過自己的努力幫助別人找到一個解決問題的辦法，你會因此找到理想的生活方式。

## 接受

「不要思考誰對誰錯，也不要比較誰更好。不要贊同也不要反對。」

如果我們希望地球變得更美好，我們必須放下意見、偏見還有頑固的信仰。沒有必要分清對錯，或認為你比別人更好。萬事皆自然。如果你不喜歡，你可以做別的，但是不要注入否定的能量，因為這毫無益處

## 專心

「我不害怕曾經練過一萬種踢法的人，但我害怕一種踢法練過一萬次的人。」

如果你想有所成就、有一技之長，那你必須停止反復涉獵和嘗試。認准一件事，然後堅持到底。他們放棄得太快。不要成為他們中的之一！

## 創造

「以無法為有法，以無限為有限。」

是你限制了自己。即使是權威告訴你不可能也並不意味著不可能。他們都是和你一樣的人。記住，最偉大的人總是被告知他們永遠不能完成所願，但他們全然不顧，照樣努力並最終獲得成功。聆聽你內心的想法，做自己想做的事。

## 簡單

「簡單是開啟智慧的鑰匙。」

簡化你的生活，去除那些不必要的。作為一個社會，我們被教育說要消費，要佔有物質。幸運的是，我們開始意識到這並不管用。幸福源自內心，而不是外在。簡單使你清透，使你內心寧靜。

## 找到自己的路

「抓住有用的，拋棄沒用的，加入獨有的。」

開始時，向你尊敬的人學習，但是當你日漸優秀，更加成功時，去無用的、存有用的。我們都是獨一無二的，所以我們必須找到自己的最佳狀態，然後聽從自己的。聽從你的內心，以此為指引。能吸引你的在哪裡？

## 行動

「知道還不夠，你必須實踐，想法還不夠，你必須去做。」

你可以閱讀需要的所有資訊，但是如果你不行動，什麼都不會發生。你可能永遠都不會一清二楚，所以你不得不在混亂和茫然中努力。我知道你需要一個堅如磐石的保證，告訴你你一定會成功，但事實是，這種事是不存在的。要想達成既定目標，你必須行動起來。

## 自我

「功夫其實就是種自知之明。一拳或一腳並不是要擊倒你面前的對手，而是擊倒你的自我、恐懼還有阻礙。」

你做的每件事都涉及你的自我。這是令人害怕的。它希望你保持舒適、便捷、安全。 如果聽從你的內心，你就知道那並不是你的路。追求你的夢想，大膽去做。接受內心的恐懼，繼續前行。
